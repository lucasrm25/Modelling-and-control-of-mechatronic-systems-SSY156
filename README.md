## Assignment 01: Forward, inverse and inverse differential kinematics 

The purpose of this lab assignment is to practice with approaches to modeling and control of multi-body mechanical systems.

 In this assignment, we made use of DH parameters in order to derive:
 
 - Forward kinematics
 - Inverse kinematics
 - Inverse differential kinematics
 
 for the OMNI Bundle and KUKA robot



## Assignment 02: Robot dynamics and system identification

- Derivation of the dynamics equations for the OMNI bundle robot using the Euler-Lagrange equations.
- Identification of the parameters of the OMNI Bundle dynamics equations using System Identification Theory based on measurements collected in the laboratory.


## Assignment 03: Control in configuration and operational space

- Trajectory generation
- PID descentralized control
- Centralized control using inverse dynamics scheme to follow the trajectory in the configuration space
- Centralized control using inverse dynamics scheme to follow the trajectory in the operational space
- Impedance control design
